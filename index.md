## Welcome to my personal blog

I am Gilian and currently I am a MSc Marketing student at Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (The Netherlands) and Web Analyst at Nextail. In my free time and work I learned a lot about programming languages (R, JavaScript and Python). They made my life a lot easier during my work experience and education. My goal with this blog is to write about my experiences and projects which I enjoyed most. Hopefully you will find these interesting and educational. If you ever want to reach out to me. You can send an email to gilianponte@gmail.com or go to my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilianponte/).

I hope you enjoy my content,

Gilian
