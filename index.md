## Welcome to my personal blog. 

Here I will write about projects that I did or that I am working on. 

I work as a web analyst and currently I am a master marketing student. In my free time and work I learned a lot about programming languages (R, JavaScript and Python). They made my life a lot easier during my work experience and education. My goal with this blog is to write about my experiences and project which I enjoyed most. Hopefully you will find these interesting and educational. If you ever want to reach out to me: gilianponte@gmail.com. 

I hope you enjoy my content,

Gilian
