## Welcome to my blog

My name is Gilian Ponte, 23 years old and born/living in the Netherlands. Currently, I am a MSc Marketing student at Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. In my free time and work I learned a lot about programming languages. For example, R, JavaScript and Python. These languages made my life a lot easier during my work experience and education. 

My goal with this blog is to write about my experiences and projects which I enjoyed most. Hopefully you will find these interesting and educational. If you ever want to reach out to me. You can send an email to gilianponte@gmail.com or go to my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilianponte/).
