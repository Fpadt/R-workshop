This article presents a comparative study of churn estimation methods. Telecommunication providers can no longer rely on a steady customer base. Machine learning methods are applied to the problem of customer churn in the telecommunications industry. In the first section, relevant variables for explaining churn behaviour are evaluated. Followed by a description of the methodology of a logistic regression, decision trees, bagging, boosting and a neural network to model churn behaviour. These models are estimated and evaluated by comparative performance measures. The results show that bagging performs better than decision trees, boosting, neural network and a logistic regression. Will a neural network outperform the more classical approaches?

Machine-learning technology powers many aspects of modern society: from searching on the web to recommendations on e-commerce websites, and it is increasingly present in consumer products. Machine learning also has shown promising results in natural language understanding, topic classification, sentiment analysis, question answering and language translation. This post describes how to create a neural network to recognize clothing pieces in pictures provided by [Zalando](https://zalando.com).

Scraping is a time-saving skill. It makes you save time for more important things in your daily routine work or hobbies (for example: getting coffee for your colleagues). More important in my experience, for most companies it enables the company to analyse its competitors' pricing strategy, product availability or collect reviews to do a sentiment analysis. In this case, we will scrape some prices from a Dutch webshop (please don't sue me).
